# Amazon Sales Analysis

I completed my Amazon sales analysis project by first storing the raw sales data in an Amazon S3 bucket. Then, I set up a stage in Snowflake to efficiently load and process the data. Using Power BI Desktop, I connected to Snowflake and created a comprehensive dashboard divided into three sections: Overview, Products, and Product View.

In the Overview section, I discovered interesting insights such as total sales units and the top-selling cities and states. The Products Analysis section allowed me to dive into different product categories and analyze shipment statuses. Lastly, the Sales Trend Analysis section revealed seasonal influences and the impact of promotions on sales.

Throughout the project, I delved deeper into shipment statuses to identify process improvements and examined regional demand for targeted marketing strategies. Understanding sales performance over time helped me identify key seasonal trends and promotionalÂ effects.
